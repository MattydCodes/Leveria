Chapter 3 - Balance 
The WARDEN entered the VOID and faced the OVERLORD...faced the DARKNESS. 
The LIGHT didn't return what Leveria had lost, but the DARKNESS had been pushed back. 
Leveria didn't recover over night, but the army of DARKNESS started to retreat to the VOID and the cultists that chose to follow fled. 
The KINGDOM eventually reformed with new people, new kings...but the story of the mad king that tried to save his people wasn't forgotten. 
With symmetry and stability restored, the WARDEN OF LEVERIA roams the lands...a stranger to this new world. 
Thanks for playing Leveria!
