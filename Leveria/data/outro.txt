Chapter 2 - Cataclysm 
With the final strike of the sword, the OVERLORD starts to fade at the hands of the WARDEN... 
An innocent whisper is heard; 'I'm Sorry...' 
And with that, nothingness encloses the WARDEN... 
Where the OVERLORD once stood now presented A SWORD - both of LIGHT and DARK. 
With two hands, the WARDEN grabbed the SWORD OF DAMOCLES. 
As the VOID feebly resonates with power, the WARDEN returned to Leveria, a sword of light and dark in hand...
