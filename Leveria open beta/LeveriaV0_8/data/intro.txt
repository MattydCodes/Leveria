\~Chapter 1 - Symmetry~/ 
Leveria was once a land of peace and prosperity, but that is no longer...
In the ages of early man, the balance between the LIGHT and the DARK was stable and in symmetry. 
The land of Leveria formed a KINGDOM and was ruled by the just and wise KING DAMOCLES. 
However, one year, the KINGDOM started to collapse; poverty fed on everyone, famine fed no one and disease fed the cessation of existence.  
In desperation, KING DAMOCLES sought powers he didn't understand, in the hopes to help his people. 
His findings led him to the DARKNESS... 
He knew restraint when handling such powers, however, KING DAMOCLES still grew too consumed by the DARKNESS, leading himself and his followers astray... 
The KING was lost to the VOID and never seen again... 
Years went by, with Leveria slowly recovering. 
But...KING DAMOCLES eventually returned from the VOID. 
His mind had been truly lost and was now known as the OVERLORD, leading an army of DARKNESS across Leveria. 
The KINGDOM fell, and many citizens of Leveria were never seen again. 
YOU...A young protector, a WARDEN OF LEVERIA, is now entrusted with saving the land and the people that remain. 
The DARKNESS ravages still, but the LIGHT pushes back within you...
